# ✅ Success Metrics Document  
## SERP-First AI Blogging Platform

This document defines **what success actually means** for the platform.  
Metrics are designed to measure **SERP impact, authority growth, and durability** — not vanity output.

## 1. Primary Success Metrics (Non-Negotiable)

### 1.1 SERP Outperformance Rate
**Definition:**  
Percentage of published pages that outperform the SERP median within 90 days.

**Why it matters:**  
Ranking relative to competitors is the only real success signal.

---

### 1.2 Ranking Stability Score
**Definition:**  
How long a page maintains its ranking band (±3 positions).

**Why it matters:**  
Temporary rankings are noise; stability signals trust.

---

### 1.3 Update-to-Publish Ratio
**Definition:**  
Number of content updates vs new publishes.

**Target:**  
> Updates ≥ New posts

**Why it matters:**  
Authority compounds through maintenance.

---

### 1.4 Topical Authority Coverage
**Definition:**  
Percentage completion of topic clusters (pillar + supporting pages).

**Why it matters:**  
Google trusts ecosystems, not isolated posts.

---

### 1.5 SERP Feature Capture Rate
**Definition:**  
Percentage of pages earning snippets, PAA, tables, or rich results.

**Why it matters:**  
Visibility beats raw position.

## 2. Secondary (Supporting) Metrics

- Dwell time improvement vs SERP average  
- Bounce rate delta after intro optimization  
- Internal link depth per topic cluster  
- Entity coverage expansion rate  
- Decay detection & refresh success rate  

---

## 3. Explicit Non-Metrics (What We Ignore)

- Articles published per day  
- Word count per article  
- Keyword density scores  
- AI token usage  
- Prompt creativity  

**Reason:**  
These correlate poorly with ranking success.

---

## 4. Final Metric Philosophy

> If it doesn’t measure **SERP dominance or authority growth**, it’s not a success metric.

---

## How to Improve Beyond Industry Standard
- Introduce **ranking durability benchmarks** instead of traffic spikes  
- Compare metrics against **SERP median**, not historical self-data  
- Penalize volume without performance  
- Tie metrics directly to platform feature gating
