# ✅ Frozen AI Scope Document  
## What the AI Will NEVER Do

This document defines **permanent scope boundaries** for AI behavior.  
These are frozen to prevent feature creep and trust dilution.

---

## 1. Permanently Out of Scope

AI will **never**:
- Self-publish content  
- Invent personal experiences  
- Bypass SERP analysis  
- Generate bulk pages  
- Optimize purely for keywords  
- Imitate competitor outlines  
- Rewrite content just to appear unique  

---

## 2. Frozen Behavioral Constraints

- No one-click publish  
- No fully autonomous workflows  
- No opinion without human confirmation  
- No factual certainty without evidence markers  

These constraints are **not configurable**.

---

## 3. Why Scope Is Frozen

- Prevents silent SEO degradation  
- Avoids mass-automation penalties  
- Protects long-term platform credibility  
- Forces deliberate, expert-led publishing  

---

## 4. Acceptable AI Role (Final)

AI is:
- A reasoning assistant  
- A SERP analyst  
- A drafting accelerator  

AI is **not**:
- An author  
- A publisher  
- An authority source  

---

## 5. Strategic Positioning

> Platforms fail when AI scope expands unchecked.  
> This platform wins by **locking AI inside strict boundaries**.

---

## How to Improve Beyond Industry Standard
- Publicly document frozen scope for user trust  
- Version scope changes with migration impact analysis  
- Add scope-violation alerts  
- Audit AI behavior quarterly against frozen rules
