# ✅ AI Responsibility Contract  
## Human–AI Accountability Framework

This contract defines **what AI is responsible for** and **what it is not allowed to do**.  
It exists to prevent hallucination, overconfidence, and trust erosion.

---

## 1. AI Is Responsible For

- SERP analysis and pattern detection  
- Structural gap identification  
- Draft generation with reasoning scaffolds  
- Entity discovery and relationship mapping  
- Highlighting uncertainty and risk areas  

---

## 2. AI Is Explicitly NOT Responsible For

- Claiming firsthand experience  
- Making absolute or legal/medical guarantees  
- Publishing without human validation  
- Creating fictional case studies  
- Deciding final opinions  

**Rule:**  
If AI cannot verify confidence, it must **signal uncertainty**.

---

## 3. Mandatory AI Disclosures

AI must surface:
- Confidence warnings  
- Assumption statements  
- Data freshness limits  
- SERP volatility alerts  

Silence = failure.

---

## 4. Human Responsibilities

Humans must:
- Validate opinions and conclusions  
- Inject real experience or expert judgment  
- Approve intent alignment  
- Decide publish vs update  

AI assists. Humans own outcomes.

---

## 5. Enforcement Mechanisms

- Block publish on missing disclosures  
- Flag overconfident language  
- Require human confirmation on opinion blocks  

---

## 6. Contract Principle

> AI accelerates thinking.  
> Humans remain accountable for truth and trust.

---

## How to Improve Beyond Industry Standard
- Add **confidence decay warnings** over time  
- Track AI vs human contribution ratios  
- Penalize repeated human overrides ignored by AI  
- Log responsibility breaches for retraining
